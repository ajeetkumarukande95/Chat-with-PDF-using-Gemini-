# Chat-with-PDF-using-Gemini
This Streamlit application allows users to interact with PDF documents using natural language questions. It leverages Google's Gemini Pro model and FAISS for vector search to provide accurate answers based on the content of uploaded PDF files. The application also includes conversational memory, allowing it to remember the context of previous questions.

## Features

- **PDF Text Extraction**: Upload one or more PDF files and extract their text content.
- **Text Chunking**: The extracted text is split into manageable chunks for efficient processing.
- **Vector Store**: Uses FAISS for storing and searching text chunks based on their embeddings.
- **Conversational AI**: Integrated with Google Gemini Pro to generate detailed responses.
- **Conversational Memory**: Remembers the last few interactions for context-aware responses.
- **Interactive UI**: Streamlit-based UI with an easy-to-use interface.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Google API key (for using Google Generative AI)
